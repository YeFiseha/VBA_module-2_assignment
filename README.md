# VBA_module-2_assignment
Stock-analysis
In this assignment, we have created a script that loops through all the stocks traded in three different years and generated the information described in the findings section below.

# Findings

The following information is generated about the stocks traded during the three years period - 2018, 2019, and 2020:

* ticker symbols during each year (reflecting the stock price changes within each year)
* difference between opening and closing stock prices for each year (reflecting whether the stocks have been profitable)
* percentage change between opening and closing price in each year (reflecting the extent of increase or decrease in stock value)
* total stock volume (total number of shares) traded during the specified period (i.e., in each of the three years)

In addition, the following summary information is also generated:

* The highest incremental percentage change in stock price during the year
* The highest decline in percentage change of stock price during the year
* The highest total stock volume during the year


# Formatting

The positive changes in stock prices are highlighted in green (indicating profitability) and negative changes are highlighted in red (reflecting loss).

# References

The adjustment to the script allowing it to run on every worksheet (that is, for every year) simultaneously is obtained with the guidance of a tutor.
For the calculation of the summary information, google search and youtube videos of VBA exercises were used as reference. 
For the calculation of total stock volume and in re-arranging order of codes, tutor support and guidance was used to adjust the script.
